title: 'Crypto and Central Banks'
---

So much has been written about cryptocurrencies and their conflict with central banking systems that only the Sentinelese would not know about it. Crypto has been a major store of value for people who do not want their wealth to grow or wane at the whims of bankers and politicians. Crypto has also been accused of enabling money laundering and funding criminal and terror activities. States have always been suspicious of how much power it holds over their economic systems and rarely let it without an oversight.

The promise of crypto has always been that it would not be controlled by a single entity. This promise makes it an extremely good candidate for the world's reserve currency. I'm writing this in 2026 and it has been more than a decade of bitcoin being around, but no such discussions are going on. Why is that?

With the dollar instability and countries rushing to de-dollarify thier economics - by dumping US Govt bonds, buying gold and silver, making bilateral trade pacts - it makes me wonder - could crypto be the answer to this frenzied world?

This is a thought experiment, so please bear with me.

Let's start by listing out the characteristics we want in the world reserve currency.

- It should not be tied to a country.
- No single entity should control it.
- It should be abundantly availble, but not limitless.
- It should be easy to adopt.

I'll work with a assumed crypto called the 'Fabric'.

Fabric would be available to central banks of countries to settle trade, not individuals. This way, countries can protect thier sovereignty, and set thier own policies as to how thier economies would work. 
Every currency would have a Fabic/CC pair which would be determined based on supply and demand.
Now over to minig of Fabric. This is the tricky part because of -
- #1 We need to ensure that one country doesn't produce majority of it and hence control the system because of the 51% rule.
- #2 We need to make sure that any new country joining this system as a net consumer doesn't end up locked out of the system.

For problem #1 I do not have an answer yet.
For problem #2 we can setup loaning facilities - but how? And who would loan?
Loans are not a crypto function?
Contracts are, eg, Ethereum. We could leverage it.
