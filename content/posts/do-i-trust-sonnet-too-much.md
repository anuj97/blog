title: 'Do I Trust Sonnet Too Much'
---

It's been around six months that I got my hands on windsurf. My working style has completely changed because of it. I make a mindmap of what's supposed to be done and put some TODOs in the file I need changes in, and let windsurf do the rest. My go-to model is sonnet, v4.5 right now. I'm impressed at how less credits it uses and produces such good code.

I was reading something Kailash Nadh wrote a while back.
